# Network Automation with SDA and DevNet Fundamentals

Welcome to the **Network Automation with SDA (Software-Defined Access) and DevNet** repository! This project is designed to help network engineers and developers automate networking tasks using Python, DevNet tools, and SDA principles. The project provides a structured approach to network automation, featuring different use cases and end-to-end automation solutions, with a focus on leveraging modern CI/CD pipelines to ensure continuous deployment and testing.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository includes multiple use cases and solutions for automating network operations. Each folder contains a unique network automation scenario with scripts, configurations, and step-by-step guides.

### Key Highlights:
- **Python-Based Automation:** Scripts written in Python to handle tasks such as device provisioning, configuration changes, network monitoring, and more.
- **DevNet & SDA Integration:** Best practices for leveraging Cisco DevNet's tools and APIs to implement Software-Defined Access (SDA) in automated network environments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implementing a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing, validation, and deployment of network changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

To ensure consistency and smooth development, the project begins with setting up the Python environment. You can easily install all necessary dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

### Steps to Set Up the Environment:
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-automation-sda-devnet.git
   ```
   
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Core Dependencies:
- **Netmiko**: To simplify SSH connections and automate device configurations.
- **Nornir**: A Python automation framework for managing network configurations.
- **Paramiko**: Secure shell (SSH) connectivity for remote device control.
- **Pytest**: For test automation in CI/CD pipelines.

## üìÇ Project Structure

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific network automation use case. The structure is designed to ensure that users can easily navigate through different scenarios and solutions.

### Folder Breakdown:
- `VLAN provisioning/`: Automating VLAN provisioning in SDA environment.
- `onboarding/`: Automating device onboarding and configuration using Python scripts.
- `monitoring/`: Network monitoring and alerting using REST APIs and Webhooks.
- `configuration/`: Automating network configuration rollback using version control.
  
Each use case comes with:
- A well-defined problem statement.
- Step-by-step instructions on implementing the solution.
- Relevant Python scripts and configuration files.
- CI/CD pipeline integration to continuously test and deploy solutions.

## üîÑ End-to-End Network Automation Solutions

For each use case:
1. **Define Use Case & Problem Set:** We identify the network challenge to solve, such as automating repetitive configuration tasks, enhancing network monitoring, or enabling zero-touch provisioning.
   
2. **Python-Based Solution:** Develop Python scripts that interface with network devices using CLI commands, APIs, and libraries such as `Netmiko` and `Nornir`.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate the deployment of network changes, perform unit tests, and validate configurations.

### Example Pipeline Workflow:
- **Continuous Integration:** Automatically run tests on network configurations, validate changes before they are deployed, and ensure code quality.
- **Continuous Deployment:** After successful testing, automatically push configuration changes to network devices.

## üìà Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For automating network operations and solutions.
- **Netmiko/Nornir**: For handling device configuration and connectivity.
- **DevNet**: Cisco‚Äôs suite of tools and APIs to enable network automation.
- **Ansible**: Automation of network device provisioning (optional).
- **CI/CD Pipeline Tools**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI for automating the development and deployment pipeline.
